Procedure for getting updated code:

Do this BEFORE you edit things or check things in.

   hg update


Procedure for checking in code using Mercurial, with our google code repository at http://code.google.com/p/timeforscience/:

  If the file "YOURFILE" is new:
      hg update
      hg add YOURFILE
      hg commit -m "Fixed the long-standing bug"
      hg push

Or, in one line:
	hg update ; hg commit -m "Committing without a proper comment!" ;
And then:
	hg push

To start:

	This will make a "TimeForScience" folder in your home directory. You can
move it to any location, or rename it, as you see fit.
	
	hg clone https://timeforscience.googlecode.com/hg/ ~/TimeForScience
