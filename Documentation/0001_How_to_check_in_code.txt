========================================================

For the VERY FIRST TIME you want a Mercurial repository:

This will make a "TimeForScience" folder in your home directory. You can
move it to any location, or rename it, as you see fit. Note that later instructions
assume that you did in fact name your repository "TimeForScience" and put it in your
home directory. If you did not, you will have to remember what you call it and change
the later instructions accordingly!
	
  hg clone https://timeforscience.googlecode.com/hg/ ~/TimeForScience
    This creates a new directory named "TimeForScience" in the base level of your home directory.

Now you will need to read "0005_How_to_set_up_your_path.txt" to see how to set up your shell's path.

========================================================

Procedure for getting updated code. You will want to do this every so often to get bug fixes!

First command:
   cd ~/TimeForScience
     You must be in the source code repository for this to work!

Second command:
   hg pull
     This checks the google code server to find out what has been changed.

Third and last command:
   hg update
     This actually overwrites the local files with the updated ones.


========================================================
Procedure for uploading your changes to the google code repository:

First command:
   cd ~/TimeForScience
     You must be in the source code repository for this to work!

Second command:
   hg pull
     This checks the google code server to find out what has been changed.

Third command:
   hg update
     This actually overwrites the local files with the updated ones.

Fourth command, which is only for new files:
   hg add MY_NEW_FILE
   This tells Mercurial that you have a totally new file that you made. Make sure to put it in a sensible location!)
   You can skip this step if you aren't creating a totally new file.

Fifth command:
   hg commit -m "Fixed the bug in this file, so I am uploading it"
     This tells your local computer that you have a change to make, but it does NOT
     send it to the server yet!! (it is NOT like CVS commit!)

Last command:
   hg push
     This sends your updated file's changes to the server.
     Note: you will have to type your username and password here, UNLESS
     you put your password in your config file. Read on for instructions on how to do that.

========================================================

To avoid having to type in the annoying auto-generated password every time, you can save your password in a local file. Note that anyone on the filesystem can read this file, so don't use a password you care about! The password is stored as plaintext! Anyone can read it!

There are two steps:

1. Here are the two important lines that should be in the file ~/TimeForScience/.hg/hgrc :

[paths]
default = https://YOUR_USERNAME_HERE:YOUR_PASSWORD_GOES_HERE@timeforscience.googlecode.com/hg/
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              Put your username here         and password here
              (note that anybody can read these!)

2. For a tiny bit of additional security, now run:
        chmod -R og-rx ~/TimeForScience/.hg/
    to make it only "very easy to read your password" instead of "incredibly easy."
