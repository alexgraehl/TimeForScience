# When you log in to a system, the C-shell executes commands in the .login file after executing the .cshrc file. Unlike the .cshrc file, the .login file is read only once when you log in and not when subsequent commands are issued. The .login file should include instructions for initializing remote terminals and setting up special variables called environment variables. It is best to set the same environment variables in your .login and .cshrc files. See Appendix C for samples on setting terminal characteristics and branching on machine types.


# Note that there is also a .logout file

#source ~/.cshrc # <-- this will cause weird multi-logins

#if ($?prompt && ($HOST =~ 'jive*')) then


#if ($?STY && $HOST =~ 'jive') then
#    source ~/.login
#endif

# If this machine is the stupid one that won't load .login by default
# AND we have a prompt (i.e., it is interactive),
# then load the login like we are SUPPOSED to anyway.
if($?prompt && $HOST =~ 'jive') then
    source ~/.login
endif


# If we are running a shell from inside emacs, then source the ~/.login file!
if ($?EMACS) then
    if ($EMACS =~ 't') then
	source ~/.login
    endif
