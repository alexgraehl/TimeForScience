# If you want to have MULTIPLE GITHUB accounts on one machine:

# Default github account, assumes your SSH private key is in ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Github has a special syntax (?) for alternate accounts: hyphen + repo name.
# 1. In your ~/.ssh/config:
# Host github.com-{{TOP LEVEL ACCOUNT NAME GOES HERE}}
#    HostName github.com
#    User git
#    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/{{YOUR_SPECIAL_ID_RSA_FOR_JUST_THIS_REPO}}

    # REPO/.git/config file, specifically for this line:
    # url = git@github.com-{{TOP LEVEL ACCOUNT NAME GOES HERE}}:path/ToThe.git
    # The 'url' line must have the hyphen in it, or nothing will work!
    # You may also need a [user] \n email = youremail@users.noreply.github.com
    # to be specified... maybe.
