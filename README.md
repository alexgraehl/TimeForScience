* Enhanced unix tools (usually implemented in Perl). "cut.pl," for example, is like "cut," but allows you to easily re-order the output.
* Enhanced set-operation files. Joining / selecting specfic items / performing database operations on files is much easier than trying to just use "join." Also, "sets.pl" for turning a sets into lists of pairs, and vice-versa.
* Graphical / Plotting tools: programs like plot.R and various R scripts for making nice figures.
* UNIX configuration files. This is a good place to find usable emacs / shell / etc configurations
