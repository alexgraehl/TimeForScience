# Readme: Snakeboard Emoji Keyboard

This is a Mac keyboard layout that lets you easily type emoji. It replaces everything that was previously typed with "option + shift" held down. Now, that key combination + a letter will type an emoji of some type.

It was made with the "Ukelele" keyboard-editing (https://www.google.com/search?q=ukelele+mac+keyboard+application).

### Installation:

(These instructions MIGHT be out-of-date, so you can try to search online for: "Mac: how do I change keyboard layouts" or "Mac: how do I install a custom keyboard layout", if you need assistance.)

1. Download the appropriate `...bundle.tar` keyboard layout (for example, `EmojiKeyboard_Snakeboard.1.3.bundle.tar`) from this directory.

2. On your computer, double click the `.tar` file to uncompress it. (That should create a file that ends in the extension `.bundle`.)

3. Drag the newly-extracted `.bundle` keyboard layout to your personal Mac `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` directory.

   * Note: `~/Library` might be an invisible directory: so you may need to use the Mac "Go" menu ("Go --> Go To Folder...", in the top menu bar) and then type `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` to go to that directory)

4. Is the `.bundle` in your Keyboard Layouts directory? (It will most likely be the *only* file in that directory.)

5. Go to the Mac System Preferences. Open the `Keyboard` preferences. Click "Edit..." in the "Input Sources" section of the Keyboard control panel. Find the "Emoji Snakeboard" layout (it might be in *English*, or possible all the way at the bottom of the menu in the *Other* section). Add it.

6. While you're at it, in that same "Input Sources" control panel, toggle on the "Show Input menu in menu bar" option. A tiny icon should appear in the top-right of your Mac's menu bar. This is the keyboard layout "input switcher" menu.

7. Click that icon. You should see an icon of a snake, and the words "Emoji Snakeboard." Select that keyboard.

Now, you should be able to type emoji by holding option + shift + (some keys). (Check the "Keyboard Viewer" option--also in the input switcher menu--if you want to see all the options. You'll need to hold option + shift while you view the keyboard layout, or it will just look like the regular A-Z letters.)
