# Readme: Snakeboard Emoji Keyboard

This is a Mac keyboard layout that lets you easily type emoji. It replaces everything that was previously typed with "option + shift" held down. Now, that key combination + a letter will type an emoji of some type.

It was made with the "Ukelele" keyboard-editing (https://www.google.com/search?q=ukelele+mac+keyboard+application).

Installation: drag the keyboard layout to ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts, then go to the Keyboard preferences and enable the "Snakeboard" keybaord. You can then switch between keyboard layouts using the icon in the menu bar. (Search for "Mac: how do I change keyboard layouts" or "Mac: how do I install a custom keyboard layout" online, if you need assistance.)
