__DATA__

ditto_mark.pl [OPTIONS] < STDIN

Alex Williams, 2008

Replaces two *consecutive* instances of the same value in
the same column with a ditto mark.

In other words, duplicate values in a column will be shown
as a ditto mark, except for the first one.

Can be undone with the --undo flag UNLESS your ditto mark
also appears as a valid value in a field, in which case
--undo will mess things up. (So try to pick a unique DITTO
option.)

See the examples below.

CAVEATS:

 * "Undo" will not work if your ditto character is also a valid value (all by itself)
   for a cell in a column that is operated on.

OPTIONS:

-d DELIM or --delim=DELIM  (default: tab)
  Sets the column delimiter.

-m or --mark=STRING (default: double quote mark)
  Sets the ditto mark that indicates that a field is the
  same as the one above. The default is the same as -m '"' .
  The ditto can be multiple characters, like
  -m "--DUPLICATE--"  .


-f RANGES: specify columns to ditto-ize. Default: ALL columns operated on.
           RANGES are comma-separated lists of single columns or a range of columns
           for example:

                -f  1-3,5-6,2
            or
                -f  5-6,2,1-3   <-- does the same thing

           would dittoize columns 1 through 6 except column 4.  Note
           that 2 is redundantly specified, but no error results.

           If RANGES is a file, then cut.pl reads in the ranges from the given
           file. Each line is treated as a seperate range if multiple lines
           are given.

           Should work with negatives (counts from the end of the list instead).


--undo
   Does the opposite of normal execution, restoring a file to its pre-dittoed state.
   This will succeed *unless* the ditto character is also a valid data value that
   appears alone by itself in a cell.

EXAMPLES:

If you have a file like this:
ALPHA,1,1,2,3
ALPHA,2,4,5,1
BETA ,2,1,3,4
BETA ,4,1,5,1

Then you can say

ditto_mark.pl -d ',' -m 'SAME' THE_FILE

And the output will be:
ALPHA ,    1,    1,  2,  3
SAME  ,    2,    4,  5,  1
BETA  , SAME,    1,  3,  4
SAME  ,    4, SAME,  5,  1

As seen above, "SAME" is probably not a very good choice as a mark.
The default is a more-noticeable double-quote (\").

If you want to UNDO ditto-marking, run ditto_mark.pl with the --undo flag.

For example:
ditto_mark.pl FILE | ditto_mark.pl --undo FILE
will result in the original file... but ONLY as long as the ditto mark character 
  only appears alone in a cell as a result
  of ditto_mark.pl. If the ditto character is a valid data cell, then you will get
  different (and incorrect) results. This is one reason you should use a unique
  character for the ditto character.

KEYWORDS FOR FINDING THIS PROGRAM WITH GREP:
