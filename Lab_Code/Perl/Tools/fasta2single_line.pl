## Fasta to one line: turns the lines from normal fasta format:
## >SOMETHING
## blah blah
## more blah
## blah 2 3 4
## something else
##
## Into a set of lines like:
## SOMETHING  blah blah
## SOMETHING  more blah
## SOMETHING  blah 2 3 4
## SOMETHING  something else
##
## This way you can sort them afterward.

__DATA__

fasta2single_line.pl:

This is primarily used for formatting sets_overlap.pl output. It does the following:

It turns these fasta-format lines:
 >SOMETHING
 blah blah
 more blah
 blah 2 3 4
 something else

Into a set of lines like this, where the set name appears on every line:
 SOMETHING  blah blah
 SOMETHING  more blah
 SOMETHING  blah 2 3 4
 SOMETHING  something else

 This way you can easily sort them afterward.

Usage:


One common usage is:                           vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
 sets_overlap.pl -dot -p 1 SETFILE1 SETFILE2 | fasta2single_line.pl > OUTPUT_FILE
                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Options:

 -d=DELIMITER  or  --delim=DELIMITER (default: <tab>)
  For example,  -d ','   or   -d 'x'   sets the delimiter to comma or x, respectively.
  Note that this *only* sets the new delimiter between the fasta header and the rest
  of the lines, and not any delimiters that may already exist in the fasta file.
