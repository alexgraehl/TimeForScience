__DATA__
syntax: sets_overlap.pl -p CUTOFF  [OPTIONS]  GOLD_SET TEST_SET

    GOLD - Gold-standard classification set

    TEST - Test classification set

Calculates similarity between sets. Uses the hypergeometric calculation for p-values, which are reported
as log10(p_value) for each test/gold pair.

EXAMPLE USAGE SCENARIO (i.e., "what is sets_overlap.pl for?"):

You use sets_overlap.pl when you want to see if a list of things is likely to belong to a particular
set. For example, if you had a test set of genes:

EXPERIMENT_1_SET    alphaGene     gammaGene     omegaGene     betaGene     epsilonGene

and you wanted to know if those genes had some function in common, you could overlap it with the
"gold standard" functional set:

Mitosis_Genes       gammaGene  omegaGene   betaGene    muGene   epsilonGene   alphaGene
DNA_Repair_Genes    geneZ      geneY       alphaGene

sets_overlap could tell you that your set seemed likely to be involved in Mitosis (and not so much in
DNA repair).

The command to run the above example (assuming you made the proper files) would be:
   sets_overlap.pl  -p 1  Experiement_1_Set_File.name   Functional_Set_File.name  > OUTPUT.file


CAVEATS:
    By default, NOT ALL RESULTS ARE PRINTED. Only p-values better than the cutoff (0.05) are reported.
    Specify "-p 1" (cutoff of P = 1.0) to print ALL results.
    (Specifiy -p 0.9999 to print the results that have any overlap at all.)

    In the output file, p-values are reported as log_base_10(p_value). Thus,
    1.0 is the worst ("no significance") and more-negative numbers are more significant. You can
    reverse this with -no (negate output).

    Note that significance only reports if something has significantly MORE overlap than expected.
    We do *NOT* detect a sets with significant UNDERrepresentation (they just have bad p-values)

    You can use the program "fasta2single_line.pl" to process the
    output of sets_overlap.pl and make it easier to sort the results or put them in a spreadsheet.
    Here is how you do it:
       sets_overlap.pl -dot OTHER_PARAMETERS | fasta2single_line.pl > OUTPUT_FILE

    It will turn this:
       >Set1
       Guy1	142	42	13
       Guy2	42	11	22

    Into this:
       Set1     Guy1	142	42	13
       Set1     Guy2	42	11	22

    Note that "-dot" is important! Otherwise the list is comma-separated, which means that fasta2single_line.pl
    will mess up any set names with commas in them!

    Also consider using -dot (tab-delimit the output) in order to get an easily-"cut.pl"-able result.
    The default output delimiter is a comma (which is troublesome if set names contain commas).

OPTIONS:

    -q: Quiet mode (default is verbose)

    -no: (Negate output)   (default: OFF)
    Negate output value: bigger numbers are better if this option is specified.
	Normally the score value printed is the log10(pvalue). With this option,
	it is the NEGATIVE log10(pvalue). The worst score is still 0. A score of
	2 now means P = 0.01.

    -U UNIVERSE: Set the universe of elements to UNIVERSE.  UNIVERSE should be
    a file containing a list of members, with a single member on each
    line. This option overrides the -UT or the -UG option (see below).

    -UT UNIVERSE: Same as the -U option only specifies the universe from which the
    TEST sets were drawn. By default, the union of all TEST sets is
    used as the TEST universe.

    -UG UNIVERSE: Same as the -U option only specifies the universe from which the
    GOLD sets were drawn. By default, the union of all GOLD sets is
    used as the GOLD universe.

    --IU=FILE | --individual_universe=FILE : An "individual universe" file that
    specifies a separate universe of items to consider for each item in the test
    set.
    Note: if you specify -IU, you MUST use the equals sign to specify the file.
    ("--IU file" will NOT work, but --IU=file WILL work)
    The format is:   ELEMENT <tab> UNIV_ITEM_1 <tab> UNIV_ITEM_2 <tab> etc...
    This feature is useful in situations where one gene was tested against a
    large panel, but others were only tested against a small panel. We do not
    want to penalize the small-panel genes for not being tested in many conditions,
    nor do we want to re-run sets_overlap with a different universe file for
    each entry.
    Sample file, with ITEM_B tested more thoroughly than ITEM_A:
      ITEM_A <tab> 1 <tab> 2 <tab> 3
      ITEM_B <tab> 1 <tab> 2 <tab> 3 <tab> 4 <tab> 5

    Note that any entries that do not appear in the -IU file simply use the
    default universe calculations (as if you had not specified -IU=FILENAME at all).
    Thus it is possible to have both -IU and also -U/UG/UT.

    -N NUM: Set the population size to NUM. Overrides the default, which is to
    simply count the number of items in the universe. Note: the N specified here
    is superseded by the count in the -IU (individual universe) file, if you
    specify one.

    -I: Use the intersection of the GOLD universe with the TEST universe
    for the population size (default uses the union). Use this option if
    you do not want to penalize a test set from drawing members that were
    not in the GOLD universe, and on the other hand, if you do not want to
    include members of GOLD sets that do not appear in the TEST universe.

    -G: Use the GOLD universe as the common universe. The -I flag supercedes
    this option.

    -T: Use the TEST universe as the common universe. The -I and -G
    flags supercede this flag.

    -M MAX: Set the maximum size used for the GOLD.  Any
    GOLD set that is larger will be ignored.  If MAX is
    a value between 0 and 1 then it is interpreted as a
    fraction of the population size.

    -kg COL: Set the key column to COL (default is 1).

    -kt COL: Same as -kg but for the TEST file.

    -do DELIM: Set the output delimiter of the stats to DELIM (default is a comma).

    -dot (with no argument): Sets the output delimiter to a tab (default is a comma)
        Can be accomplished with "-do '	'" as well. This option is occasionally
        useful, since tabs frequently get clobbered when copying and pasting.

    -dg DELIM: Set the field delimiter for the GOLD set to DELIM (default is tab).

    -dt DELIM: Same as -dg but for the TEST file.

    -hg HEADERS: Set the number of header lines to HEADERS (default is 0).

    -ht HEADERS: Same as -hg but for the TEST file.

    -mg: The GOLD classification is in matrix format (default is list format)

    -mt: Same as -mg but for the TEST file.

    -ig: The GOLD file contains an inverted listing with members down the first
    column and sets across. Saves you from having to modify the lists
	using sets.pl (which is how you would deal with this otherwise).

    -it: Same as -ig but for the TEST file.

    -ignore FILE: Supply a list of sets to ignore in the TILING.

    -p PVAL: Supply a p-value cutoff (default is -p 0.05, which only reports overlap
      with P-values of 0.05 or lower (better). (Note that this is about -1.3 in log10(p) terms.)

    -noself: Do not compare sets that have the same name. Useful for when GOLD=TEST.

    -sf SIGFIGS: Set the number of significant figures for reporting P-values to
    SIGFIGS (default is 4).

    -o OUTPUT_TYPE: Specify whether to print the statistics of the overlaps out ('stats')
    to print the members with their category assignments in the significantly
    overlapping categories ('members').  By default this is set to 'stats'.

EXAMPLE:

    If example set file A consists of (tab-delimited):
    Group1  1       2       3       5
    Group2  2       4       6

    And example set file B consists of (tab-delimited):
    ODD     1       3       5       7       9
    EVEN    2       4       6       8

    Then "sets_overlap.pl B A -p 1" will give you:

    >Group1
    ODD,-0.447158031342433,3,4,5,9
    EVEN,-0.191885526238794,1,4,4,9
    >Group2
    EVEN,-1.32221929473412,3,3,4,9
    ODD,0,0,3,5,9

    Note that B is the "GOLD-standard" file (ODD & EVEN), whereas A is the "test" file of
    unknown groups. The order in which the files are specified is significant!

    The sets are always printed in the same order that they are found in the test (second) file.

    From the results, we see that, for
    example, Group2 is more simliar to EVEN than ODD.
    It has 3/3 overlap with the elements in EVEN,
    giving it a log-base-10 p-value of -1.322.

    For Group1, the line "ODD,-0.447,3,4,5,9" means:
    N ,  A   ,B,C,D,E

  N: Name of this set (the second set)
  A: Score
  B: Overlap between sets
  C: Num elements in first set
  D: Num elements in second set (the set "N")
  E: Total number of unique elements (union of 1st and 2nd sets)

  More details:
    A. The log_10(p-value) of at least this amount of overlap
    between the two sets ODD and Group1 is -0.447.
    B. 3 elements from the Group1 set were also in the ODD set...
    C. Group1 had 4 members in all.
    (i.e., 3 out of 4 elements in Group1 were also in the ODD set)
    D. The ODD set had a total of 5 elements in it (it was of size 5)
    E. The universe of all possible elements was size 9 (here, it happens to be the numbers 1..9).
    This last number will always be the same for every result line.

    The universe of all elements is automatically computed by "union"-ing all the entries.
    Or it can instead be manually specified with the "-U" switch on the command line.


Revision History:

    May 2007: Added "-IU" (individual universe) option for specifying different
              universes for different items.

	March 2008: Added "-no" for outputting -log10(pval) instead of log10(pval).
    This way, higher scores are BETTER (and 0 is still the worst).
    (This is *NOT* the default option!)

    May 2008:
    sets_overlap.pl now prints out the sets in the same order that they were
    found in the *test* file (not the gold file). (alexgw)
    Previously, sets were printed out randomly based on the Perl hash order.

    May 2008:
    Added "-dot" for setting output delimiter to a tab. Prevents
    tab copy-paste Makefile bugs. (Previously possible with -do '	'.)
