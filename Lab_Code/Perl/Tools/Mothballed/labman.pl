__DATA__

labman.pl 'SEARCH_TEXT_HERE'

labman.pl will find any programs that lab members have written that contain the selected text.

Searches are case-insensitive.

This is like the unix "man" and "apropos" commands. However, it is tailored specifically to our lab software.

(Internally, it is a wrapper around grep and find.)

 EXAMPLES:

Suppose you are wondering if someone already wrote a program to make a historgram, for example,
you could type:
    labman.pl  histogram   | less -S

Or maybe you are thinking about writing a program to calculate the median value of a line,
but you suspect someone might have already written it:
    labman.pl  median   | less -S

Queries with spaces in them should be enclosed in quotes:
    labman.pl  'pearson corr'   | less -S
