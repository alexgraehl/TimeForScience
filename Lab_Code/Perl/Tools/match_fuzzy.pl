match_fuzzy.pl [OPTIONS]  FILENAME1   FILENAME2
by Alex Williams, 2009

"Fuzzy matching between strings"

If you want to automatically match a string like "Mitochondrial Cell
Metabolism" to "Mitochond. Cell Metab.", then you want to use this program.

Example: match_fuzzy.pl -c 0.3 file1 file2

This program takes in two columns of strings (one in each file), and outputs
the edit distance between each pair of items, as well as some other statistics.

The cutoff can be anything between 1.0 (show everything) to 0.0 (exact only).

The input files should be tab-delimited (although -d can override this) and
look like:

File1.tab:
porpoise           something    else   whatever
horse              a thing

File2.tab:
purpose          more_things     that do not matter
horseshoe crab

The output will only involve the first column from each file. (In this case, it
would indicate the number of changes required to turn the string "porpoise"
into "purpose", the number of changes from "porpoise"->"horseshoe crab",
"horse"->"purpose" and "horse"->"horseshoe crab".

The output columns give the strings being compared, the length of these
strings, the edit distance required to turn string 1 into string 2
(case-insensitively), and the number of edits required divided by the string
length. Additionally, "direction-dependent" edit distances are provided, which
depend on the order of specified strings. "horse"->"horseshoe crab" would have
a *directed* edit distance of 0 (the string "horse" is already in "horseshoe
crab"), but an un-directed edit distance of 9 (9 letters/spaces must be added).

See the examples below for more information.

CAVEATS:

Default is case-insensitive. Use --casesens to care about case.

Default prints out ALL pairs. So this is O(N*M) if N is the number of strings
in file1 and M is the number of strings in file2.

Use -c <THRESHOLD> to reduce this, or manually sort/filter later.

OPTIONS:

  -c CUTOFF   (Default: 1.0 (least stringent))
     Only print pairs of strings that are similar enough to make the cutoff.
     The cutoff is defined as: (edit_distance)/max(length(string1),
     length(string2)). -c 1.0 prints EVERY pair. -c 0.0 prints only perfect
     matches. -c 0.15 would print only strings that are pretty close, but not
     necessarily exact.

  --fast or --faster or --levonly
     Only calculate Levenshtein distance, do not output the other distances.
     Speeds things up if you only care about the Levenshtein edit distance.
     (Note: probably you can run this, since it is unlikely that you care about
     the extra columns).

  --casesens or -s (Default: OFF)
     Case-sensitive edit distances. By default, capitalization is disregarded,
     so ITEM and item are identical. But with --casesens, ITEM and item have an
     edit distance of 4 (4 changes required to turn ITEM into item or vice
     versa).

  -d DELIM or --delim = DELIMITER   (Default: tab)
     Sets the input delimiter to DELIMITER. For comma-separated, you would say
     -d ','

  -q: Quiet mode (do not print anything to STDERR)
     Default is "verbose".

EXAMPLES:

Assuming that the first column of both FILE1 and FILE2 are strings that you
want to compare:
     Show only strings that are somewhat similar:
          match_fuzzy.pl -c 0.3   FILE1   FILE2   >   myOutputFile

     Same as above, but only care about the most important fields:
          match_fuzzy.pl -c 0.3  --faster  FILE1   FILE2   >   myOutputFile

     Show ALL information:
          match_fuzzy.pl  FILE1  FILE2

     Care about case, run faster and show only the most useful information:
          match_fuzzy.pl  --casesens  --faster  FILE1   FILE2

     Pipe in a file, then process it:
          cat FILE1 | sed 's/natl/national/g' | match_fuzzy.pl - FILE2  > OUTPUT

Note that -c 0 reports EXACT MATCHES only, and is thus
similar to a normal "join" operation in many ways.

KNOWN BUGS:

  None known.
