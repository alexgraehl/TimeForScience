__DATA__

count_items_per_line:
 Counts the number of items per line, AFTER the initial item, which is assumed to be a header for
 the row (although you can change that with -addamt=1) . Counts based on the delimiter on that line.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
  You may want to use "row_stats.pl -count" instead of this program!

Usage:
  count_items_per_line.pl [OPTIONS]  <FILE|STDIN>


Options:
 -d=DELIMITER or  --delim=DELIMITER   Default: tab
    Sets the column delimiter. Can be a regular expression, but make sure to format it properly.
    Uses the perl "split" command, so it can take any regular expression that split can understand.
    Normal usage example: -d=',' would count the number of items on a column-delimited file

 -a=NUMBER  or  --addamt=NUMBER   (Default: 0)   Short for "add amount"
    Adds NUMBER to each count, so you do not have to manually post-process the file.

 -t  or --title  (Default: do not print titles, just counts)
    Print the item title at the beginning of each line, then a tab, then the count of remaining items.

Q: If you are using this program, have you considered using row_stats.pl -h 0 -count instead? Note that the output is slightly different due to headers!!!
